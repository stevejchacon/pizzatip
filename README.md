# Pizza Delivery Driver Tip Analysis

A pizza delivery driver kept track of the tips that they earned during their shifts from August 2020 - December 31, 2022. The "HoursTracker" app was used to clock-in/clock-out for each shift works as well as log the tips earned for the shift. Initial curiosity arose from a discussion amongst the delivery drivers who were speculating how much they actually earned. Like any tip-based job, income fluctuates based on the time of day, the day of the week, and occasion. Occassions can be anything from a holiday to a football game. 

TO DO:
- explain holidays (the variety)
- football games


Questions: Are holidays worth working, did the menu price increase & delivery charge increase affect the tips,

explain lack in ability to track when the tips were earned


Approach to the D3 Visualizations:
- While performing this analysis, there was effort made to self study a LinkedIn Learning HTML Essential Training course by Jen Simmons. This beginner course was ideal for trying to learn the foundations of HTML which played a key-role in being able to create the layouts for the D3 visualizations``
