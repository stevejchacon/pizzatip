# Pizza Delivery Driver Tip Analysis

OUTLINE/DRAFT/NOTES

- INTRO -> what is the project, what is the influce for the project, what tools
were needed (tip tracker app)

- METHODOLOGY/REASONING -> the main goal was to perform the tip analysis but more
so, to gain as much experience as possible in the most ways possible. To acheive
this, the analysis was performed multiple times: matplotlib, seaborn, D3, Tableau.
The reasoning for this is because each visualization package/software has its own
nuances and desirable for different areas of work. Each also presents its own set
of challenges and this project does its best to face all of them. 
Disclaimer: some visualizations may not have the most "meaning" but were still
created. The reason for this is because from an educational appraoch, I still found
some of the visualizations worthwhile to create despite their lack of impact. At
times, I found myself in a position where the visualization was not necessarily 
something that I had created before so I just made it for the point of learning.

- DATA -> put in data table (similar to how I did for 424). 

- NOTEBOOKS/FILES -> list and detail


- INSIGHTS ->

- CHALLENGES -> 




A pizza delivery driver kept track of the tips that they earned during their shifts from August 2020 - December 31, 2022. The "HoursTracker" app was used to clock-in/clock-out for each shift works as well as log the tips earned for the shift. Initial curiosity arose from a discussion amongst the delivery drivers who were speculating how much they actually earned. Like any tip-based job, income fluctuates based on the time of day, the day of the week, and occasion. Occassions can be anything from a holiday to a football game. 


Questions: Are holidays worth working, did the menu price increase & delivery charge increase affect the tips,

explain lack in ability to track when the tips were earned


Approach to the D3 Visualizations:
- While performing this analysis, there was effort made to self study a LinkedIn Learning HTML Essential Training course by Jen Simmons. This beginner course was ideal for trying to learn the foundations of HTML which played a key-role in being able to create the layouts for the D3 visualizations``
